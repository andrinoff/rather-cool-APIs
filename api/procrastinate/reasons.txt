You can just do it tomorrow.
You work better under pressure anyway.
You need to 'mentally prepare' first.
The conditions aren't perfect yet.
You're waiting for inspiration to strike.
You should probably clean your entire house before you start.
A quick nap will surely boost your productivity later.
Just watch one more episode, it won't hurt.
You need to research the 'best' way to do this first.
Your horoscope said today is not a good day for this.
You'll start as soon as this song is over.
Your cat might have sneezed, you should go check.
The lighting in this room just isn't right for this task.
You need to align your chakras first.
Maybe you should consider a new career path instead.
