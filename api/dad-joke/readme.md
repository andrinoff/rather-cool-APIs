A simple, fun API that delivers a random dad joke. Perfect for when you need a good chuckle or a terrible pun.

---

## ü§î What is it?

This is a lightweight, serverless API built with Python and designed for deployment on Vercel. It reads from a list of classic dad jokes and returns a random one every time you call it.

## üöÄ Usage

To get your random dad joke, simply send a `GET` request to the API endpoint.

**Endpoint:** `/api/dad-joke`

### Example Request

You can use `curl` or any HTTP client to make a request.

```bash
curl https://api.andrinoff.com/api/dad-joke
```

### Example Response

The API will return a random joke as a plain text response.

```
Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!
```

Or maybe...

```
I'm reading a book on anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down!
```
